MAJOR TASKS:

-Basic Timer Functionality - DONE!
-Add and Subtract Time to 'Work' - DONE!
-Create Greeting when Timer finishes using switch statement or nested if/else - INCOMPLETE!!!


To Do's:

-refactor to make functions reusable
    -specifically the addWork, subWork & addBreak, subBreak functions
        -there should really only be two functions: 1 for adding time and 1 for subtracting time regardless whether that's applying to the Break Counter or the Work Counter

-consider adding all functions and put inside the main 'Timer' function
-Create BREAK MODE to switch between WORK TIME and BREAK TIME

PROCESS OF APP:

-Grab time from Work Section
-Subtract 1 from the number of minutes and subtract 1 from the number of seconds.
-Use that as the counter in the timer()
-Display the output in the main display section
